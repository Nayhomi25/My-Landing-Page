### Acknowledgments
 This project is based on the starter code provided by Udacity. I used some help from the internet to improve and add new css styles to the project. No JavaScript code is copied from others, but I did use the documentation to read more about how some functions work and how to invoke them with some options and i also used variations of code found on teaching sites to make it work. I tried to use the funtions that I've learnt in the course, although I know there may be more direct as well as  better and more functional approaches.

### Usage
Html web page ready to view on any type and size of web browser.

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.
